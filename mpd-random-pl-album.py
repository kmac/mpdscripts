"""
This script picks a random album from the MPD playlist.  Called with no
args it will pick a random album from the current playlist and start
playing.

It can also monitor MPD and select a new album in the playlist after the
last song on an album has ended. Use the -d option

Options:
   -h|--help
   -d|--daemon  : daemon.  Monitor MPD for track changes. At end of album select 
                  a new random album from the playlist
   -D|--debug   : Print debug messages to stdout
   -p|--passive : testing only. Don't make any changes to the MPD playlist

Requires:
   python-mpd

Limitations:
   The album switching is currently triggered when we hit the last song
   on an album.  If the user changes the current song selection during
   the last song on an album then this script will kick in, randomly
   selecting a new album.  Unfortunately I don't see how to avoid this
   unless I was to time how long the last song has been playing for, and
   compare it to the song length given by MPD.
